            <p>
                I hate that I can't be there to hug you when you're sad or hold your hand when you're doubting us. 
                But please listen to my voice—it will never lie to you. <br><br>
                My love for you isn't based on a physical presence; it's based on the soul I've come to know through every hour-long conversation we've had. 
                You are real to me. We are real to me. <br><br>
                Don't let the miles make you forget how much you matter. You are my home, even from a thousand miles away.
